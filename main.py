NEA Year 12 Project
Author: Joe Sykes
Date Started: 9/9/22
Idea:
My idea for my NEA is to make a formula one set-up simulator where you get randomised a track, and either if it is raining or not, and you choose your driver and try to create the perfect set-up for them to win the race
'''
# automake the other drivers set-ups and then give a recommendation to the reader to say what they can do better
